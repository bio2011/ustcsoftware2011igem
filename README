MoDeL v1.1

===========================================================================
Introduction

We are aimed to developing a novel approach to enable fully automatic
modeling process for synthetic biological systems. The notion of
reaction rules are borrowed from Kappa and BNGL language and we apply
it to face the new challenges brought by the role of DNA and RNA 
sequences in the regulatory relationships in biological networks. With
the help of database techniques, users are only required to submit
the assembly of BioBrick parts (the design) and then a computational
model is generated automatically by our program. This is quite helpful
for the new comers of the syn-bio community to understand how individual
BioBricks affect the whole behaviors of system dynamics. Obviously, not
all people are familiar with modeling stuff and it should be time-consuming
and error-prone, if done manually, even for professional.

===========================================================================
What's new?

It is an extended project based on the work of 2010 USTCSoftware iGEM
team. The codes have been rewritten using perl with large amounts of
modifications in the characterization of rule-based languages we used,
namely, MoDeL (Standard BioBrick Part Modeling Database Langugae). In
addtion, relational database MySQL is used to replace XML-native DBXML
develped by Oracle. Such efforts have significantly improved the quality
of our program in both time and memory performance. The previous Cpp
version can be found at http://ustc-igame.sf.net.

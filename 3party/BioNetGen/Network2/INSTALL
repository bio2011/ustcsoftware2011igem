network 1.0

A set of programs to generate and solve chemical reaction networks.
These programs have been used to develop complex models of cell signaling
cascades (see Refs. 1-3 below).

This file contains abbreviated instructions for compiling the network program.

This package has been incorporated into the BioNetGen package, which is
available from http://cellsignaling.lanl.gov/bionetgen.

This program is freely available and distributable under terms given in the LICENSE file.

The COPYRIGHT notice for the CVODE code, written and maintained at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, which is also contained in this distribution is
in the directory CVODE.

**************

Installation from the BioNetGen root directory

1) cd to directory network_xx, where xx is the version number of the network
distribution.

2) Examine the Makefile to see if the compiler name and options and additional
library names are appropriate to your particular system.  These may be changed
by editing this file or preferably by creating a new file called makeincl.

3) Make the run_network executable by typing "make".  A successful build will automatically
place the executable in BioNetGenRoot/bin.  To test if build is
successful, try running ../bin/OSTYPE.  You should see the output

Usage:
run_network [-c] [-s] [-f] [-o outprefix] [-g groupfile] [-t tol] [-r rtol] [-a atol] netfile sample_time n_sample
or
run_network [-c] [-s] [-f] [-o outprefix] [-g groupfile] [-t tol] [-r rtol] [-a atol] netfile t1 t2 ... tn

If you encounter problems at this point, please contact your local Unix
expert, or, when all options at your local site have been exhausted, the
author will be happy to assist.  

4) Before proceeding to verifying the run_network output for particular
models, as described in the BioNetGen manual 
(http://cellsignaling.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/bionetgen/install.cgi), you may wish to
clean up the files associated with compilation by typing "make clean".

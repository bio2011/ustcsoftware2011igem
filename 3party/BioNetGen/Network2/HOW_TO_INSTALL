This file contains instructions on how to install run_networks from source
code.

1) Download SUNDIALS (you only need cvode) from:
   http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/sundials/download/download.html

2) Follow the installation instructions for SUNDIALS. In most cases you will
   only need to run:
        tar -zxf sundials.tar.gz
   On Solaris you may need to do:
        gunzip sundials.tar.gz
        tar -xf sundials.tar

   If you have administrative access and wish to install SUNDIALS system wide
   to the following:
        cd sundials
        ./configure
        make
        su
        make install

   If you do not have adminstrative access or do not desire to do a system
   wide install do the following:
        cd sundials
        ./configure --prefix=/INSTALL_PATH/
        mkdir /INSTALL_PATH/
        mkdir /INSTALL_PATH/lib
        mkdir /INSTALL_PATH/include
        make
        make install
   For more SUNDIALS configuration options see the SUNDIALS documentation

3) cd /BIONETGEN_PATH/Network

4) Open the MakeFile. Set the SUNPREFIX directory to the correct directory for
   your installation of sundials.

5) run make:
        make

6) You can test the install by running:
        ../bin/run_network
   The output should be:
        Usage:
        run_network [-b] [-d] [-c] [-m] [-s] [-f] [-o outprefix] [-g groupfile] [-t tol] [-r rtol] [-a atol] [-z iteration number] netfile sample_time n_sample
        or
        run_network [-b] [-d] [-c] [-m] [-s] [-f] [-o outprefix] [-g groupfile] [-t tol] [-r rtol] [-a atol] [-z iteration number] netfile t1 t2 ... tn
